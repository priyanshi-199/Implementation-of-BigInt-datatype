# Implementation-of-BigInt-datatype
This program implements a custom BigInt data type tailored to manage integers up to 1024 bits in length. It supports fundamental arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, and multiplication. This custom BigInt implementation ensures robust functionality for both positive and negative numbers, addressing scenarios where standard data types like int or long long are insufficient due to their limited size. Emphasizing efficient computation, the program provides comprehensive support for large integer arithmetic, making it suitable for executing complex numerical operations that demand extended precision.
